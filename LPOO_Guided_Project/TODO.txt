TODO LIST

X - Marked as finished
? - Marked as under development


1. Features

X - Develop first level base mechanics 			(TP1 - Task #1 to #4)
  - Develop second level (Ogre Boss Battle)		(TP1 - Task #5 to #6)
		X - Design map
		? - Ogre behavior (adapt to new guard representing class when available)
		- Ogre's club implementation
	
2. Refactoring (Code organization and Readability)

X - Develop a class for representing guards (might be useful if many guards of the same style appear).
X - Develop a class for the player to keep track of its position, movement and other effects.
X  - Develop a class for representing positions, movement direction and adjacency effects (like guard capturing player)
	to avoid repeating code for various entities.
? - Develop an Entity SuperClass serving as a backbone to all entities (Player, Guard, Ogre, etc..)
  - Develop a class for managing game logic (game initialization and exit, map gameplay loop, etc..)
	
  - Clean up main() by distributing load across other classes to make it more readable and straightforward.
  - Develop a mechanism to avoid repeating code for exiting program (a simple exit() function can solve this for now, 
  	might not be necessary depending on how main() is organized).
